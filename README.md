## How to Play

```text
Both the player and the dealer start with two cards. The dealer's first card is hidden.
Decide whether to take another card ("hit") or stop at the current total ("stand").
The dealer reveals the first card and decides to hit or stand based on a minimum score of 17.
The round ends if you stand, exceed 21, or achieve Blackjack (21 with two cards).
Wins are determined based on the final hand values compared to the dealer's.
